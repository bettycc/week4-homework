# Week 4 Homework
(5 points)

This is the last homework assignment of the quarter!  Isn't it sad? :-)

FORK this repository before you start.

DUE: You must push your code to GitHub no later than **Tuesday, July 21 at 5:29PM**.

### Overview

This app "works" - but the implementation violates HTTP best practices.

Your job is to clean up the code so that it follows best practices for RESTful design.  You don't need to add any new functionality. When you are done, the app should still appear to behave the same way from the user's perspective.

You will discover a couple of new Rails features we haven't explicitly talked about in class.  They're not essential for this assignment but hopefully inspires some imagination for next week's class.

### The Challenge

Go through every component of Rails and change the code to conform to best practices:

1. (1 pts) Make sure all of the routes follow the "Golden 7" HTTP method/URL conventions.  (The lone exception is the `root` route.)
1. (2 pts) Make sure all controllers follow the "Golden 7" action naming conventions.
1. (2 pts) Make sure your views transmit requests using the proper HTTP methods.

Happy coding!
